# Time Series Analysis of Precipitation and Soil Moisture 

## Introduction
Precipitation and soil moisture observations can act as crucial features in understanding various 
environmental phenomena. They can augment the features extracted from satellite imagery for applications 
like crop yield predictions, etc.

This project aims at analysing the relationship between the earth's precipitation and soil moisture data and attempts 
in finding how these observations are related.

## Data sources
The following data sources are used for the analysis.
1. [Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_GPM_L3_IMERG_V05)
2. [NASA - USDA SMAP Global Soil Moisture Data](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NASA_USDA_HSL_SMAP_soil_moisture)
